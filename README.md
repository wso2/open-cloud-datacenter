# Open Cloud Datacenter Initiative

## What Is Open Cloud Datacenter?
Open Cloud Data Center (OCDC) is an open-source initiative to empower people to define, build, and operate cloud infrastructure on on own hardware.

All architecture, automation, tooling decisions, and operational guidance for this effort will live in this repository and be open sourced.

## Why Open Cloud Datacenter Exists
OCDC mainly exists to make own cloud infrastructure practical and accessible for individuals and organizations.

Open Cloud Repatriation is also a key objective of the initiative:

- Create a repeatable model that helps organizations and individuals repatriate workloads from public cloud to self-managed infrastructure.
- Use open source technologies so people are not locked into proprietary licensing, legal restrictions, or commercial limitations.
- Empower teams to operate production-ready cloud platforms with full ownership and control.
